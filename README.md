# Program Description: Student Management System

## Overview
The Student Management System is a web application designed to handle basic CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student records. Built using 
React for the frontend and Express with MySQL for the backend, this application allows 
users to perform various actions on student data, such as adding new students, updating 
existing records, deleting students, and viewing a list of all students.

## Key Features

### User Interface (UI)
- **Centered Form**: A user-friendly form is centered on the page, allowing for easy input 
  of student information including name, email, marks, grade, and city. The form adapts 
  to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Data Table**: Student records are displayed in a neatly styled table with borders, 
  alternating row colors for improved readability, and action buttons for editing or deleting 
  entries.

### Frontend
- **React Components**: The UI is built using React components, which handle form submission, 
  data display, and interaction with the backend.
- **Inline Styling**: All styles are applied using inline CSS within the React components, 
  ensuring that styling is contained within the JavaScript code. This approach simplifies 
  maintenance and keeps styles closely related to their components.

### Backend
- **Express Server**: An Express.js server handles HTTP requests and manages CRUD operations. 
  It interacts with the MySQL database to perform data operations.
- **MySQL Database**: The backend uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve student records. 
  The database schema includes a table for students with columns for ID, name, email, marks, 
  grade, and city.

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Users can add new student records through the form, which sends a POST request 
  to the server.
- **Read**: A list of all student records is fetched and displayed in a table format. This table 
  is dynamically updated to reflect any changes.
- **Update**: Existing records can be edited by selecting the corresponding student and 
  submitting the updated information through the form.
- **Delete**: Records can be removed from the database by clicking the delete button next to 
  the corresponding student entry.

### Styling and Layout
- The application uses Flexbox to center the form vertically and horizontally within the viewport.
- The table and form elements are styled to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with borders, 
  padding, and hover effects for buttons.
